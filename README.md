In Phase 4, I created new directories for my backend and frontend code.
Putting the express and mongodb stuff in the backend and creating a new vite app in the frontend.
Created components that were needed to handle the add movie feature from the backend by fetching the backend API using the POST method.
Changed some parts of the way stuff was saved as, for example I had to learn how to save genres as an array properly and my release year was being saved as camel case instead of snake case so I had to change it.
Created a form to take in values to create movies and add it to the mongodb cloud.
Tested my error handling for the creation of movies.
Used a css to beautify the app
